## Formato  de Dataset
Propio, el dataset contiene dos Carpetas **CXR_png/** y **ClinicalReadings/**, estás son descritas a continuación
### CXR_png/
Las imágenes contienen un nombre con el formato *CHNCXR_XXXX_0.png*, el nombre está dividido por el guión bajo por tres partes, la primera parte es el nombre del Dataset, la segunda especifica el número de imágen y la tercera si el valor es '0' significa que es un CXR Normal, en el caso de que sea '1' la imágen  corresponde a un pulmón anormal.
### ClinicalReadings/
